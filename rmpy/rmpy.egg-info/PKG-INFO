# 1. NpVaR Module

This module calculates the Non-parametric Value-at-Risk (NpVaR) and associated functions for single assets or portfolios using historical returns. 
The functions with the `yf_` prefix use data from the Yahoo Finance API, whereas the others use the provided returns. The `_single` functions are for individual assets, and the `_port` functions are for portfolios. The `_conflevel_` functions calculate the NpVaR with a specified confidence level. The `_summary_` functions provide summaries for NpVaR calculations. The `_marg_NpVaRs_scale_factor` functions calculate the marginal NpVaRs given a scaling factor.
Please refer to the code below for the syntax and examples on how to use each function. The input parameters and their usage are described within the comments.

It contains the following functions:

`1. yf_npVaR_single`

- yf_npVaR_single(ticker, position, start_date, end_date, freq="daily", alpha=0.01, kind="abs", display=True)

This function yf_npVaR_single calculates the quantile non-parametric value at risk (VaR) for a SINGLE asset position using historical prices obtained from Yahoo Finance (yfinance).

#### Args:

- ticker: the asset symbol or ticker of the company for the npVaR will be calculated
- position: the size of the position (value).
- start_date: the starting date for which we want to obtain historical prices. This can be a string in the format "YYYY-MM-DD" or a datetime object.
- end_date: the ending date for which we want to obtain historical prices. This can be a string in the format "YYYY-MM-DD" or a datetime object. By default, this is set to "today" 
which will use the current date as the ending date.
- freq: the frequency of the historical prices. This can be set to "daily", "weekly", or "monthly". By default, this is set to "daily".
- alpha: the confidence level for the VaR calculation. This is a value between 0 and 1, representing the probability of loss exceeding the VaR. By default, this is set to 0.01 (1%).
- kind: the type of VaR calculation to use. This can be set to "abs" for absolute VaR or "rel" for relative VaR. By default, this is set to "abs".
- display: a boolean value or string representing whether to display the calculated VaR. This can be set to True or False. By default, this is set to True.

### Example:

```python

The function takes in historical returns data for the assets, the current positions of the assets, a scale factor, and a significance level (alpha).The result is a list of the marginal changes in NpVaR for each asset, which can be useful for understanding the risk contributions of individual positions within the portfolio and designing risk management strategies to mitigate potential losses.

# 2. PaVaR Module


This module calculates Portfolio Value-at-Risk (pVaR) and associated functions for single assets and multi-asset portfolios using historical returns. It provides different Value-at-Risk (VaR) calculations, including marginal, component, and relative component VaRs. 
The functions with the `yf_` prefix use data from the Yahoo Finance API, whereas the others use the provided returns. The `_single` functions are for individual assets, and the `_port` functions are for portfolios. The `_conflevel_` functions calculate the pVaR with a specified confidence level. The `_und_vs_` functions calculate the undiversified pVaR, while the `_marginal_VaRs`, `_componets_VaRs`, and `_relcomponets_VaRs` functions calculate the marginal, component, and relative component VaRs, respectively.

Each function has its own set of input parameters, such as asset tickers, positions, start and end dates, frequency, and confidence levels. Please refer to the code above for the syntax and examples on how to use each function. The input parameters and their usage are described within the comments.

The following functions are included:

`1. yf_pVaR_single`

#### Args:

- ticker: The stock symbol or identifier for the financial instrument in question (e.g. "AAPL" for Apple Inc.).
- position: The value held. This can be a positive or negative number, depending if you are long or short.
- start_date: A string representing the starting date for the historical data used in the VaR calculation. This should be in the format "YYYY-MM-DD".
- end_date: A string representing the ending date for the historical data used in the VaR calculation. This should also be in the format "YYYY-MM-DD".By default, this is set to "today".
- interval: The time horizon of VaR. It is related to frequency (e.g. if "freq = 'montly' " and "interval = 1", the function compute 1-month VaR).
- freq: The frequency at which returns will be downloaded.
alpha: The significance level for the VaR calculation. By default, this is set to 0.01, which corresponds to a 99% confidence level.
- display: A boolean value that determines whether the function should display the results of the VaR calculation. By default, this is set to True, which means that the results will be displayed.

This example calculates the componet VaRs of a Portfolio consisting of a short positions of 1000 in the first asset, long positions of 2500 in the second asset,  and long positions of 7000 in the third asset.

`15. yf_relcomponets_VaRs`

- yf_relcomponets_VaRs(tickers, positions, start_date, end_date,interval = 1, freq="daily", alpha=0.01, display=True)

The function 'yf_relative_componets_VaRs' enables the calculation of the Relative Component VaRs for a PORTFOLIO by utilizing data obtained from Yahoo Finance (yFinance).

#### Args:

- tickers: A list of strings representing the tickers of the assets in the portoflio. #### Note that the tickers provided should be part of the portoflio ####
- positions: A list of integers or floats representing each position in the portfolio. This can be a positive or negative number, depending if you are long or short.
- start_date: A string representing the starting date for the historical data used in the VaR calculation. This should be in the format "YYYY-MM-DD".
- end_date: A string representing the ending date for the historical data used in the VaR calculation. This should also be in the format "YYYY-MM-DD".By default, this is set to "today".
- freq: The frequency at which returns will be downloaded.
- interval: The time horizon of VaR. It is related to frequency (e.g. if "freq = 'montly' " and "interval = 1", the function compute 1-month VaR).
- alpha: a float specifying the significance level for the VaR calculation. By default, this is set to 0.01, which corresponds to a 99% confidence level.
- display: a boolean or string value indicating whether or not to display the results. The default value is set to True.

### Example:

```python
from rmpy.PaVaR import yf_relcomponets_VaRs
tickers = ['AAPL', 'MSFT']
positions = [-1000, 5000]
start_date = '2020-01-01'
end_date = '2021-12-31'
interval = 5
freq = "daily"
alpha = 0.01
display = True
yf_relcomponets_VaRs(tickers, positions, start_date, end_date, interval=interval, freq=freq, alpha=alpha, display=display)
# OR
rcVars = yf_relcomponets_VaRs(tickers, positions, start_date, end_date, interval=interval, freq=freq, alpha=alpha, display=False)
print(rcVars)
```
This example calculates the 5-day relative component parametrics VaRs for a Portfolio with short position of 1000 in Apple Inc and a long position of 5000 in Microsoft Corp.

`16. relcomponets_VaRs`

-  rcVars = relcomponets_VaRs(returns, positions, interval=1, alpha=0.01)

The function 'relcomponets_VaRs' enables the calculation of the relative componets VaRs of a portfolio, given its returns.

#### Args:

- returns: a pandas Series or NumPy array containing the historical returns of the portfolio.
- positions: A list of integers or floats representing each position in the portfolio. This can be a positive or negative number, depending if you are long or short.
- interval: The time horizon of VaR. It is related to frequency of data used (e.g. if "freq = 'montly' " and "interval = 1", the function compute 1-month VaR).
- alpha: The level of confidence for the VaR calculation. By default is set to 0.01, which represents a 99% confidence level.


### Example:

```python
from rmpy.PaVaR import relcomponets_VaRs
import numpy as np
returns = np.random.uniform(-0.05, 0.05, size=(10, 3))  # Replace this with actual returns
positions = [-1000, 2500, 7000]
interval = 1
alpha = 0.01
rcVars = relcomponets_VaRs(returns, positions, interval=interval, alpha=alpha)
print(rcVars)
```
This example calculates the relative componet VaRs of a Portfolio consisting of a short positions of 1000 in the first asset, long positions of 2500 in the second asset, and long positions of 7000 in the third asset.
